== Adapting the Tutorial Generation Process 

In this repository, you write tutorials that are executed by the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[tutorial compiler].

Out of the tutorial specification maintained in this repsitory, it generates multiple outputs like Katacoda tutorials, website step-by-step tutorial documentation and possibly more.
