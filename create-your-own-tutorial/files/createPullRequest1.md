Before starting write content into the tutorial, you have to create a pull request from your newly created branch into the main repository.
This has the advantage that your tutorial will automatically be build and pushed to https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev. So you can directly test it.

For this step you need to open you local terminal at your forked and cloned 'tutorials' folder and run the following commands:
1. 'git add .' 
2. 'git commit -m "initial commit for tutorial myTutorial"'
3. 'git push'

This will save all the changes and push them into your tutorials GitHub repository. 

Switch to your browser and open:
https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials

Click on 'Pull requests' > 'New pull request'.
