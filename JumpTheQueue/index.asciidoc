[step]
--
restoreDevonfwIde(["java", "mvn", "node", "ng", "npm"])
--
First, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.
[step]
--
cloneRepository("", "https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git")
--

====
[step]
== Build and Run Java Server
--
buildJava("jump-the-queue/java/jtqj", true)
runServerJava("jump-the-queue/java/jtqj/server", { "startupTime": 40, "port": 8081, "path": "jumpthequeue" })
--
Now the Java Server should be running.
====

In the next steps we want build and run the Angular Frontend Server. For that you need to install the dependencies first.
[step]
--
npmInstall("jump-the-queue/angular")
--

====
Now build and run the Angular Server.
The following two steps are only needed in this tutorial. Normally you can simply execute "ng serve", open the https://localhost:4200/ and start using the app.
In the next step you need to change the Base URL for the REST Services. 
[step]
== Serve the Frontend Server
--
changeFile("jump-the-queue/angular/src/environments/environment.ts", {"content": "https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/jumpthequeue/services/rest", "placeholder": "http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue/services/rest"})
runClientNg("jump-the-queue/angular", { "startupTime": 200, "port": 4200, "path": "" })
--
Now the Angular Frontend Server should be running.
