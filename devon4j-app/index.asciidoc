= Generate your Java application with devon4j
====
devon4j is the Java stack of devonfw. It allows you to build business applications (backends) using Java technology in a highly efficient and standardized way based on established best-practices.

# Prerequisites
* User should have Java development experience

# Learning goals
After completing this scenario, you will have learned how to generate Java application using devon4j.

### create devon4j sample application


If you want to create devon4j application on your local machine there are two ways to do it:

* In eclipse as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-eclipse)

* Using command line as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-command-line)

Now, we will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. This step will guide you on how to do it.

[step]
--
createDevon4jProject("com.example.application.sampleapp")
--

Once sampleapp is created switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you can see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->sampleapp . 

sampleapp contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.

**api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.

**core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.

**batch**: optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it. To add batch module while generating from commandline use -Dbatch=batch parameter. And to generate it from eclipse using mave archetype enter batch variable value as batch in project creation page.

**server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.

If you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](#https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).

displayContent("devon4j multilayer architecture", [{ "image": "images/devon4j_proj_structure1.jpg" }])
--

As shown in above image,devon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).

Each component is divided into following layers:
* [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).

* [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.service.impl will have all rest service implementation.

* [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).

* [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.logic will contain business logic or usecase implementation.

* [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence).For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<compoenntname>.dataaccess will contain entity, repositories etc.

== Build devon4j sample application

Build the java project

[step]
--
buildJava("sampleapp", false)
--

Once build is successful you will get bootified-war generated in server module target folder. In sampleapp check for path sampleapp/server/sampleapp-server-bootified.war
