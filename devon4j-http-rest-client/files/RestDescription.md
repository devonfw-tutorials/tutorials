* ATTENTION: REST and RESTful often implies very strict and specific rules and conventions. However different people will often have different opinions of such rules. 
* We learned that this leads to "religious discussions" (starting from PUT vs. POST and IDs in path vs. payload up to Hypermedia and HATEOAS). These "religious discussions" waste a lot of time and money without adding real value in case of common business applications (if you publish your API on the internet to billions of users this is a different story). 
* Therefore we give best practices that lead to simple, easy and pragmatic "HTTP APIs" (to avoid the term "REST services" and end "religious discussions").
