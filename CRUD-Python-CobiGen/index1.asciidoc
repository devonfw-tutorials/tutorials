= Create a CRUD Python Flask application using CobiGen's OpenAPI plugin
====

The aim of this tutorial is to create a basic CRUD Python Flask application from a single OpenAPI .yml file declaring an entity. 

The code will be generated using devonfw's CobiGen. This will result in a basic application layout, the declaration of a Flask-SQLAlchemy table with the entity's attributes as columns, and a service returning JSON objects for the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.

### Prerequisites:

* devonfw workspace set up, including the CobiGen code generator and the corresponding `CobiGen_Templates` folder.
* Python 3
